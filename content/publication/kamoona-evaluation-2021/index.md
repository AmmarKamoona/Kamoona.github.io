abstract: Defect detection in the manufacturing industry is of utmost importance for
  product quality inspection. Recently, optical defect detection has been investigated
  as an anomaly detection using different deep learning methods. However, the recent
  works do not explore the use of point pattern features, such as SIFT for anomaly
  detection using the recently developed set-based methods. In this paper, we present
  an evaluation of different point pattern feature detectors and descriptors for defect
  detection application. The evaluation is performed within the random finite set
  framework. Handcrafted point pattern features, such as SIFT as well as deep features
  are used in this evaluation. Random finite set-based defect detection is compared
  with state-of-the-arts anomaly detection methods. The results show that using point
  pattern features, such as SIFT as data points for random finite set-based anomaly
  detection achieves the most consistent defect detection accuracy on the MVTec-AD
  dataset.
