abstract: Anomaly detection in video surveillance data is a challenging tasks due
  to the dynamic environment of the surveillance area. Multiple solutions have been
  proposed to tackle this problem ranging from using handcrafted features to end-to-end
  deep leaning methods. This paper proposes a model-based approach to anomaly detection
  for surveillance video data. This solution is based on sparsity estimation of pre-trained
  deep features. We aim to harvest the sparsity information of C3D deep features and
  use it as an additional information to differentiate the normal and anomalous event
  in a video. The proposed approach uses the na√Øve Bayes model within multiple instance
  learning framework. Experimental results shows that using sparsity information of
  C3D deep features could improve naive Bayes approach and enhance the accuracy of
  the decision boundary.
