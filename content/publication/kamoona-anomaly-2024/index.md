abstract: In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach for industrial defect detection
  that is modeled based on anomaly detection using point pattern data. Most recent
  works use global features for feature extraction to summarize image content. However,
  global features are not robust against lighting and viewpoint changes and do not
  describe imagesâ€™ geometrical information which, thus, cannot be fully utilized in
  manufacturing industry. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose
  using transfer learning of local/point pattern features to overcome these limitations
  and capture geometrical information of the interested image regions. We model these
  local/point pattern features as a random finite set (RFS). In addition, we propose
  RFS energy, in contrast to RFS likelihood as an anomaly score. The similarity distribution
  of point pattern features of the normal sample has been modeled as a multivariate
  Gaussian. Parameters learning of the proposed RFS energy does not require any heavy
  computation. We evaluate the proposed approach on the MVTec AD dataset, a multi-object
  defect detection dataset. Experimental results show the outstanding performance
  of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and the proposed
  RFS energy outperforms the state-of-the-art in the few shot learning settings. Also,
  we evaluated the proposed approach on needle dataset, a real life application, to
  detect defective needle samples given three different views. The results show superior
  performance compared to DiffeNet.
