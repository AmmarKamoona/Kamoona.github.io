abstract: Energy demand prediction can benefit electricity consumers, distribution
  network service providers, and system operators. It heavily depends on auxiliary
  factors, such as weather parameters (e.g., ambient temperature), which makes this
  problem more complex. Moreover, for many industrial applications, instead of aiming
  for the highest prediction accuracy, a more easily understandable and interpretable
  model that can lead to higher accuracy against the baseline model is the priority.
  Therefore, this problem still requires more investigation, especially when there
  is a specified prediction baseline to be compared with. This paper proposes a machine
  learning (ML) based prediction framework that investigates how temperature combined
  with energy consumption and simple and interpretable ML methods can be used to provide
  more precise demand forecasts and thus baselines closer to actual load profiles.
  The proposed framework is tested on two different real-world energy demand datasets.
  The analysis shows that using a simple ML model, such as a polynomial regression
  model, results in a more accurate prediction than the current baselines used in
  the energy market. The proposed ML models are not black-box type models, and thus
  are easier to explain and interpret. The ML-based forecasted demand is used as a
  baseline for demand response (DR) and is compared with the existing baselines used
  in the demand response market of Australiaâ€™s national grid.
