abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised deep temporal encoding窶電ecoding
  solution for anomaly detection in surveillance videos using multiple instance learning.
  The proposed approach uses both abnormal and normal video clips during the training
  phase which is developed in the multiple instance learning framework where we treat
  the video as a bag and video clips as instances in the bag. Our main contribution
  lies in the proposed novel approach to consider temporal relations between video
  instances in a weakly supervised setting. We deal with video instances (clips) as
  sequential visual data rather than a set of independent instances. We employ a deep
  temporal encoding窶電ecoding network that is designed to capture spatio-temporal evolution
  of video instances over time. We also propose a new loss function that maximizes
  the mean distance between normal and abnormal instance predictions. The new loss
  function ensures a low false alarm rate which is crucial in practical surveillance
  applications. The proposed temporal encoding窶電ecoding approach with the modified
  loss is benchmarked against the state of the art. The results show that the proposed
  method performs similar to, or better than the state-of-the-art solutions for anomaly
  detection in video surveillance applications and achieves the lowest false alarm
  rate on UCF-Crime dataset.
