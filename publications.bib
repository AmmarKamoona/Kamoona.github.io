	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach for industrial defect detection that is modeled based on anomaly detection using point pattern data. Most recent works use global features for feature extraction to summarize image content. However, global features are not robust against lighting and viewpoint changes and do not describe images’ geometrical information which, thus, cannot be fully utilized in manufacturing industry. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose using transfer learning of local/point pattern features to overcome these limitations and capture geometrical information of the interested image regions. We model these local/point pattern features as a random finite set (RFS). In addition, we propose RFS energy, in contrast to RFS likelihood as an anomaly score. The similarity distribution of point pattern features of the normal sample has been modeled as a multivariate Gaussian. Parameters learning of the proposed RFS energy does not require any heavy computation. We evaluate the proposed approach on the MVTec AD dataset, a multi-object defect detection dataset. Experimental results show the outstanding performance of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and the proposed RFS energy outperforms the state-of-the-art in the few shot learning settings. Also, we evaluated the proposed approach on needle dataset, a real life application, to detect defective needle samples given three different views. The results show superior performance compared to DiffeNet.},

	abstract = {Energy demand prediction can benefit electricity consumers, distribution network service providers, and system operators. It heavily depends on auxiliary factors, such as weather parameters (e.g., ambient temperature), which makes this problem more complex. Moreover, for many industrial applications, instead of aiming for the highest prediction accuracy, a more easily understandable and interpretable model that can lead to higher accuracy against the baseline model is the priority. Therefore, this problem still requires more investigation, especially when there is a specified prediction baseline to be compared with. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based prediction framework that investigates how temperature combined with energy consumption and simple and interpretable ML methods can be used to provide more precise demand forecasts and thus baselines closer to actual load profiles. The proposed framework is tested on two different real-world energy demand datasets. The analysis shows that using a simple ML model, such as a polynomial regression model, results in a more accurate prediction than the current baselines used in the energy market. The proposed ML models are not black-box type models, and thus are easier to explain and interpret. The ML-based forecasted demand is used as a baseline for demand response (DR) and is compared with the existing baselines used in the demand response market of Australia’s national grid.},

	abstract = {With the increased uptake of renewable energy resources (RES), power generation from Photovoltaics (PV) cells is gaining momentum and heavily depends on environmental and meteorological conditions. Predicting PV power generation plays an important role in power management and dispatch optimization. Due to the scales of PV systems, the generation may vary significantly, which is difficult to have accurate PV power generation prediction over different categories of customers (e.g., residential, agricultural, industrial, and commercial) using a single model. In this paper, we define the PV power generation prediction as a multitasking prediction problem, where PV generation over each of the categories is modeled as a separate prediction task. To address this problem, we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) as the predictor for each prediction task and propose a multitasking RNN (MT-RNN) framework. Instead of addressing each task individually, MT-RNN performs knowledge transfer among different tasks to improve the prediction accuracy of each task, where the knowledge is represented via connection weights and biases in each RNN. In comparison to several state-of-art deep neural network (DNN) models that solve each task individually, the superior performance of MT-RNN in terms of prediction accuracy is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised deep temporal encoding–decoding solution for anomaly detection in surveillance videos using multiple instance learning. The proposed approach uses both abnormal and normal video clips during the training phase which is developed in the multiple instance learning framework where we treat the video as a bag and video clips as instances in the bag. Our main contribution lies in the proposed novel approach to consider temporal relations between video instances in a weakly supervised setting. We deal with video instances (clips) as sequential visual data rather than a set of independent instances. We employ a deep temporal encoding–decoding network that is designed to capture spatio-temporal evolution of video instances over time. We also propose a new loss function that maximizes the mean distance between normal and abnormal instance predictions. The new loss function ensures a low false alarm rate which is crucial in practical surveillance applications. The proposed temporal encoding–decoding approach with the modified loss is benchmarked against the state of the art. The results show that the proposed method performs similar to, or better than the state-of-the-art solutions for anomaly detection in video surveillance applications and achieves the lowest false alarm rate on UCF-Crime dataset.},

Multiple solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem ranging from using handcrafted features to end-to-end deep leaning methods. This paper proposes a model-based approach to anomaly detection for surveillance video data. This solution is based on sparsity estimation of pre-trained deep features. We aim to harvest the sparsity information of C3D deep features and use it as an additional information to differentiate the normal and anomalous event in a video. The proposed approach uses the naïve Bayes model within multiple instance learning framework. Experimental results shows that using sparsity information of C3D deep features could improve naive Bayes approach and enhance the accuracy of the decision boundary.},
